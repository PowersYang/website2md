Submarine is a project which allows infra engineer / data scientist to run unmodified Tensorflow programs on YARN.

Goals of Submarine:

  * It allows jobs for easy access to data/models in HDFS and other storages.

  * Can launch services to serve Tensorflow/MXNet models.

  * Support run distributed Tensorflow jobs with simple configs.

  * Support run user-specified Docker images.

  * Support specify GPU and other resources.

  * Support launch tensorboard for training jobs if user specified.

  * Support customized DNS name for roles (like tensorboard.$user.$domain:6006)
